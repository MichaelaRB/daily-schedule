# daily-schedule
A simple program that allows the user to log their plans for the day.

## Description

Keeping track of tasks is important. Some set reminders on their phone, others use calendars. This program is designed so that a person's daily tasks from 9 am to 5 pm can all be stored in the same location. The program will tell you what the current hour is and which hours have already passed with color coding.
